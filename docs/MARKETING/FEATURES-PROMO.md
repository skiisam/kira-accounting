## 💬 Objection Handling

### "I've used AutoCount for years, why switch?"

**Response:**
"We understand — switching feels risky. But ask yourself:
1. How much time do you still spend on manual entry?
2. Can you access your data from your phone right now?
3. Are you paying for features you're not using?

KIRA offers free data migration and a 30-day trial. Try both side by side, no commitment. Most users see the difference in week one."

### "AI sounds gimmicky"

**Response:**
"Fair skepticism! Our AI isn't ChatGPT writing your invoices. It's practical automation:
- Auto-sorts your transactions (saves 5 hrs/month)
- Reads your receipts (saves 3 hrs/month)
- Flags errors before they become problems

It's AI that works in the background. You won't notice it — except when you realize you're not doing manual work anymore."

### "New software, will it last?"

**Response:**
"Valid concern. Here's our commitment:
1. Your data is yours — export anytime, any format
2. We're backed by [investors/revenue-positive]
3. 30-day money-back guarantee
4. Active development with updates every 2 weeks

We're building for the long term. But you're never locked in."

### "Looks complicated"

**Response:**
"Actually, the opposite! KIRA was designed for business owners, not accountants. 

- If you can use Instagram, you can use KIRA
- No accounting degree required
- 15-minute onboarding, not 15-hour training

Start a free trial and see for yourself. Most users are productive within day one."
