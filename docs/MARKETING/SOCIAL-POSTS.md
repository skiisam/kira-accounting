### Post 2: Pain Point Story
```
😤 以前用 Excel 记账的日子...

每个月：
❌ 熬夜对账到凌晨3点
❌ 数字对不上，找错找到崩溃
❌ 请会计师又太贵
❌ 传统软件界面像90年代

现在用 KIRA：
✅ AI自动帮你分类交易
✅ 实时同步，不怕数据丢失
✅ 手机随时查看财务状况
✅ 界面超现代，新手也会用

老板们，是时候升级了！💪

🔥 你知道吗？KIRA 可以管理多家公司！

很多老板不只一门生意对吧？
- 有人开餐厅 + 做代购
- 有人有网店 + 实体店
- 有人同时经营几个品牌

用 KIRA，一个账号就能：
📊 分开记录每家公司的账目
📈 对比各公司的业绩
💰 统一查看总体财务状况

再也不用开多个软件切换来切换去了！

你有几家公司呢？评论区告诉我！👇

🎉 Calling all Malaysian business owners!

Are you still using outdated accounting software that:
😤 Costs you hundreds of ringgit every month?
😤 Only works on your office desktop?
😤 Looks like it was designed in 2005?
😤 Makes you do all the data entry manually?

It's time for an upgrade!

✨ What makes KIRA different:

✅ AI-Powered — Our smart system automatically categorizes your transactions. No more manual sorting!

### Post 2: Problem Agitation
```
🤯 Real talk: How much time do you spend on bookkeeping every week?

We surveyed 200 Malaysian SME owners. Here's what we found:

📊 Average time spent: 8.5 hours/week
📊 67% do it after business hours
📊 82% wish they had better tools
📊 91% find it stressful

That's over 400 HOURS per year. Time you could spend:
👨‍👩‍👧 With family
📈 Growing your business
🏖️ Actually taking a break

Here's the thing — it doesn't have to be this way.

Modern accounting software with AI can cut that time by 80%.

KIRA Accounting was built to give you your time back.

### Post 4: Testimonial/Story
```
📖 Ahmad's Story:

"I run a small F&B business in Penang. 3 outlets, 12 staff.

For years, I used [competitor] and spent every Sunday doing accounts. My wife called it my 'second job.'

When my accountant recommended KIRA, I was skeptical. Another software to learn?

But after 2 weeks, I was converted.

The AI automatically categorizes 90% of my transactions. I just review and approve.

I can check each outlet's performance from my phone.

Monthly reports that used to take 4 hours? Now it's 15 minutes.

Best part? I'm saving RM150/month compared to my old software.

Sundays are for family now. 👨‍👩‍👧"

Stories like Ahmad's are why we built KIRA. 

Every Malaysian business owner deserves tools that work FOR them, not against them.
