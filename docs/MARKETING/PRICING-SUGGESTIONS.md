## 🏷️ Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### Annual Discount

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Savings |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Starter | RM79 | RM69 | 13% (RM120/yr) |
| Pro | RM149 | RM129 | 13% (RM240/yr) |
| Business | RM249 | RM199 | 20% (RM600/yr) |

**Psychology:** 
- 13-20% discount is meaningful but not desperate
- Higher savings on Business encourages upgrade
- Annual = lower churn, better cash flow

### Anchoring

Always show Business tier first (highest price) to make Pro seem reasonable.

```
"Most businesses choose Pro — it's our best value."
```

### Decoy Effect

Pro should be obviously the best value:
- Starter → Pro: 2x price but 3x companies, 2.5x users, 5x transactions
- Pro → Business: 1.7x price for unlimited everything

## ⚠️ Pricing Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Per-transaction pricing** — Feels like being nickel-and-dimed
2. **Per-company licensing** — Competitors do this; we differentiate by NOT
3. **Confusing tier names** — "Gold/Platinum/Diamond" means nothing
4. **Hidden costs** — Cloud access, backups, support should be included
5. **Price too low** — Below RM50 signals "cheap/risky"
6. **Price too high** — Above RM300 loses SME market

### ✅ Do This

1. **Transparent pricing** — All costs visible on website
2. **Unlimited where it counts** — Companies, transactions
3. **Value-based names** — Starter/Pro/Business is clear
4. **Annual incentive** — But don't force it
5. **Easy upgrade/downgrade** — No lock-in feeling
